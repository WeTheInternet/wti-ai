# Theia AI Setup Checklist (Workspace)

1) Enable AI features (experimental) if required by your Theia build.
2) Configure **OpenAI Official** provider:
   - Set API key via environment `OPENAI_API_KEY` (preferred) or in settings.
   - Consider enabling “Use Response API” for official OpenAI models.
3) Configure prompt templates:
   - Workspace template directories: `.prompts`
   - Task context storage: `ai/prompts/task-contexts`
4) Configure skills:
   - Add `ai/skills` to “AI-features > Skills > Skill Directories”
5) Configure MCP clients (later):
   - Add MCP servers (e.g. `mcp.wti.net/fs`) with least-privilege scopes.

# Suggested defaults
- Keep approval/confirmation ON for tool calls until your allowlists and auth are proven.
- Ignore build outputs via `.aiignore` to reduce noise.
